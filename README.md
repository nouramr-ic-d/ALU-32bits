# ALU-32bits
The objective of this design problem is to create an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) capable of  performing various arithmetic and logical operations on two 16-bit inputs, based on a third input  known as the "opcode." The ALU should produce a 32-bit output representing the result of the  selected operation.
